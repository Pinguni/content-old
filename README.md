# Pages

This repository is for [https://pinguni.org](https://pinguni.org)'s guide pages.  Please read the instructions below carefully before contributing.

## DO
- Fix grammar erros
- Add extra explanations, examples, expand on paragraphs, etc.

## DON'T
- **Create new pages**.  Open an issue for creating new pages/pockets/guides.  Don't commit and make a pull request.  We won't let it through.
- **Rename pages**.  Page names correspond to database table `cards`' ID numbers.  If you change the name, you'll break the page, and we don't want that to happen.
